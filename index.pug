          p Dru yoga is a graceful and potent form of yoga, based on flowing movements, directed breathing and visualisation.
          p With its foundation set firmly in ancient yogic tradition, Dru works on body, mind and spirit - improving strength and flexibility, creating core stability, building a heightened feeling of positivity and is deeply relaxing whilst rejuvenating your whole being.
          p Designed to be practised by people of all abilities, all fitness levels and all age groups, Dru is a style of yoga that can be quickly dipped into or learnt in more depth over a lifetime.

              span After attending many yoga classes over nearly 40 years, these are the best classes I have ever been to. Apart from the improved flexibility and the increased vitality and clarity of mind that the classes give, there is a sense of pure joy in taking part.
