*## them's the breaks... ##*

* it's so easy to make things complicated... *
  
breakpoints:
  ☐ too many breakpoints? => moar control, but...
    ☐ big => 'meditation' title issue
    ☐ small => header sizes and alignment
    ☐ ❓ can simplify?
  
  current:
    1500 shrink meditate
    1000 shrink meditate
    980 major portrait mode
    880 smaller headers, margins, images
    806 smaller headers, margins, images
    686 smaller headers,          images
    560 smaller headers
    460 smaller headers,          images
    386 smaller headers,          images
    359 smaller headers
  fewer means
    smaller headers in portrait mode
    -> imgs and h1 width/alignments

    ☐ posible to get rid of some intermediates, fuck it?

  what are common widths?
